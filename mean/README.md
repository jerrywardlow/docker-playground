### Angular client with Express API

Originally this was a follow-along from a [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-mean-app-with-angular-2-and-docker-compose) tutorial, now it's broken and dead in the water. The tutorial was a total failure and the authors [source code](https://github.com/gangachris/mean-docker) doesn't even run. Maybe I'll debug this, maybe I'll build something from scratch.
